- Import Postman collection & Postman env into Postman.
- Set the URL environment variable to VM's url in Postman.
- For the first login the admin credentials needs to be set. The default admin login is username: `admin` with password: `secret`. That results in the base64 encoded string `YWRtaW46c2VjcmV0`. Set this token in the environment with the key `Base64AdminCredentials`. Remember to set a secure password in body.
- Retrieve token and paste it into `AdminAuthToken` of environment variables in Postman.
